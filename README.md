# swagger-specs
Swagger specifications for various services (EVE Online related at the moment)

## Usage
You can load these specifications directly into Swagger tools by using a GitHub "raw" link.  For example, to load the [Swagger UI](http://swagger.io/swagger-ui/) with the Eve Central spec:

http://petstore.swagger.io/?url=https://raw.githubusercontent.com/OrbitalEnterprises/swagger-specs/master/eve-central.yaml

Tools like the [Swagger Editor](http://swagger.io/swagger-editor/) don't have a query param so you have to load the file in using tool menus.  In the case of Swagger Editor, select File -> Import URL... and type in  "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/OrbitalEnterprises/swagger-specs/master/eve-central.yaml".
